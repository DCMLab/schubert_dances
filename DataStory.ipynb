    "## Abstract\n",
    "Everybody has an emotional access to music, which in turn transports listeners into specific moods, atmospheres and settings. This intuitive understanding of musical pieces is grounded in structural elements such as melodic motives and rhythms, with their variations or repetitions. Our project aims at gaining an objective insight into how these patterns engender different shades of musical engagement. Specifically, we will investigate the structure and composition of Franz Schubert's \"dances\", a large set of 435 piano pieces classified in seven different types according to their times’ conventions. The conventionality of these short and catchy pieces makes them an ideal testing ground for computer-assisted analysis, but also makes them highly representative of the taste of early-nineteenth-century listeners. With our statistical investigation we hope to open a window onto this past: what did listeners expect of appealing dance-like music, and did different dance types correspond to different musical features or just to different social perspectives on the same musical features?\n",

    "\n",
    "In the time between (xxxx-yyyy) the composer Franz Schubert composed ... **TODO: short historical background**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical Background: The Viennese dance floor\n",
    "\n",
    "The “queen of all dances” (Feldtenstein, 1767) was undoubtedly the French **Menuet**. As most dance forms of the classical repertoire, the menuet originated as a transfiguration of folk tunes into the stereotyped taste of nobility and courts, and in this form it was then exported throughout Europe. Traditionally, each menuet would be coupled with a contrasting dance, the **Trio**: hard to characterise collectively, trios were individually crafted to provide variety by conveying a different character from the related menuet, and were generally more explicit in emulating the rural origins of the dance.\n",
    " \n",
    "Closer to their rural origins, both the **Cotillon** and the **Ecossaise** are country dances and both French, the latter though being inspired by the rhythms of the Scottish folk tunes. The **Galopp** was also a fast-paced dance eventually turning into the - nowdays better known - Polka. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of strictly German origin are the **Ländler** and the **Walzer**. The former was characterised by a variety of body motions interrupted by clapping and feet stamping, evoking the scenery of countryside paesant dances. On the contrary, the Walzer was a fast and smooth spinning dance that became explosively popular because of its intrinsic sensuality, to the point that it was formally banned by the authorities several times: \"In this dance, everything is circle-shaped and whirling movement, everything designed to provoke giddiness and seduce the senses.\" (Vieth, 1794). \n",
    "\n",
    "The term **Deutscher** Tanz, literally \"German dance\", was used in association with both the Walzer and the Ländler, and it is unclear whether it would also identify a dance type of its own right: in a few instances, Schubert himself happened to label the same dances as Ländler or Deutscher. \n",

    "### Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of the 435 music scores in the XML format of the open source notation software [MuseScore 3](https://musescore.org/en/download) and has been compiled for this project by GC & JH using funds of [EPFL's Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab (DCML)](https://dcml.epfl.ch/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the data set\n",
    "\n",
    "The dances are separated into 53 separate work groups identified by their number in the [Deutsch Catalogue of Schubert's works](https://imslp.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Franz_Schubert). This division is reflected in the data set's folder structure. The [file list](https://github.com/DCMLab/schubert_dances/blob/master/data/MuseScore_3/merged_ids.tsv) contains the overview of all MuseScore files and contains the following columns:\n",
    "* **id**: Identifier of every piece as assigned by the music theorist Yosef Goldenberg of the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance\n",
    "* **D**: Deutsch number of the corresponding work group\n",
    "* **no**: piece's number within the work group\n",
    "* **dance**: which of the eight dance types has been attributed by the composer (**labels**)\n",
    "* **path**: relative path to the file\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Labels: Dance types\n",
    "\n",
    "The titles of the different dances convey which type they were attributed to by Schubert. We consider these attributions as labels enabling us to group the data set and try to characterize the different groups. The distribution over the different dance types is as follows:"

Also, we have excluded the 6 dances which are doublings of other ones and matched the filenames to the IDs that the music theorist Yosef Goldenberg of the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance uses in his manual analysis of the data set.

The point of departure for all our analyses is the concatenated note list of all sections of all pieces which we have stored [as a TSV file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DCMLab/schubert_dances/master/data/tsv/note_list_complete.tsv). Additionally, we make use of the [file measure_list_complete.tsv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DCMLab/schubert_dances/master/data/tsv/measure_list_complete.tsv) which contains high level information about every bar (note that the words bar and measure can be used interchangeably), such as meter, key signature or measure number.\n",

Measure numbers frequently span multiple measure counts and had to be computed by the parser following the usual conventions.\n",

    "**Index**\n",
    "* **id**: one ID per piece for easy addressing\n",

    "* **onset**: temporal position of the note relative to the previous bar line expressed in quarter beats (see explanation for `duration` below)\n",
    "* **duration**: duration of the note expressed in quarter beats; a quarter beat has the length of 1/4 of a whole note (or a 4/4 measure); therefore a half note (or a 2/4 measure) has length 2 and a dotted half note (or a 3/4 measure) has length 3)\n",
    "* **gracenote**: whether or not the note is a grace note and which type; grace notes are ornamental and likely to be excluded from most automated analyses; this is the only non-numerical feature but will be mainly used as a boolean value such that `Nan = False`, i.e. 'not a grace note'.\n",
    "* **nominal_duration**: note value before applying the altering `scalar`\n",
    "* **scalar**: value encoding the alteration of the `nominal_duration` caused by dots and triplets (or other n-tuples)\n",
    "* **tied**: three possible values (other than NaN):\n",
    "  * `1` if the note is tied to the next one (meaning that the next one is not causing a new attack)\n",
    "  * `-1` if the note is being tied to by the previous note (meaning that it prolongs the previous note's duration)\n",
    "  * `0` if the note is being tied to AND is tied to the next one (i.e. `-1 + 1 = 0`)\n",
    "* **tpc**: stands for Tonal Pitch Class and is a numerical encoding of tone names such that `C = 0`. All other names are ordered along the line of fifths:\n",
    "  * descending from C: `F = -1`, `Bb = -2`, `Eb = -3` etc.\n",
    "  * ascending from C: `G = 1`, `D = 2`, `A = 3` etc.\n",
    "* **midi**: encodes which piano key needs to be pressed to produce this note, meaning that `midi` information encodes in which octave the note is sounding (unlike `tpc`) but not as which note name the note is written in the score (note that the same key on the piano is pressed to produce different note names (`tpc`s), for example the key `midi == 66` can be written in a score as F#4 (`tpc == 6`) , Gb4 (`tpc == -6`), E##4 (`tpc == 17`), Abbb4 (`tpc == -18`) etc. where 4 designates octave 4).\n",
    "* **staff**: whether a note is written in the right hand (`staff == 1`) or in the left hand (`staff == 2`)\n",
    "* **voice**: In Common Music Notation, when simultaneously sounding notes with different durations appear in the same `staff`, they have to be written in different layers. MuseScore can represent up to four different layers per `staff`, with `voice == 1` usually represents the highest. Note that this is the notational notion of the word 'voices', not the musical one: `voice == 1` can contain more than one simultaneous event with the same `onset` and `duration` (i.e., a chord), whereas in the musical sense, an 'upper voice' or 'melody' consists only of one note at a time and is difficult to automatically extract from a score.\n",
    "* **volta**: Some repeated sections are played with different endings the first (`volta == 1`) and the second time (`volta == 2`). These endings ('voltas') can span one or multiple measures and the measures in a second volta have the same measure numbers as the ones in the first.\n",

    "# Classifying dance types\n",
    "\n",
    "This huge repertoire of piano pieces was intended for the private enjoyment of the Viennese bourgeoisie, whose social gatherings invariably involved music and, clearly, group dancing. Accordingly, each piece in the corpus bears as a title the name of one of the most common dance types of Schubert’s times. The title could not be assigned randomly, as the music had to match smoothly the common-sense expectations regarding the specific choreography that characterised each dance. Musicians and dancers were often amateurs, and yet, whenever the word “Walzer” or “Ländler” was heard everyone would also have known how the music would have sounded like, and  how to move on the dancing floor. However, it is by no means trivial to tell what the exact differences among dance types would be, and whether  these difference were encoded in the score or rather in the unspoken conventions of a specific social group striving to establish its status and identity in the powerful and dynamic environment of the early-19th-century Vienna. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the Walzer and the Ländler could be experienced as the extremes of a continuum in a role-playing game across social classes, with the refined Walzer representing the high-class status eventually degenerating, but just for apotropaic fun, into the rural Ländler (Witzmann, 1976).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will attempt to single out musical features from the score that can be hypothesised to characterise different dance types, and assess to what extent they account for the original destination of the pieces as intended by the composer. "

Among the remaining dances, the Ecossaises are the only ones in duple meter (oom-pah-oom-pah rather than oom-pah-pah-oom-pah-pah): even the time-signature alone would provide perfect accuracy in recognising this dance type. Accordingly, we will focus on the non-trivial task of classifying the five triple-meter dance types: the French Menuet and Trio, and the German Ländler, Walzer and Deutscher. "

    " Simplicity is the keyword for a popular musical product aimed at universally meeting the taste, and the keyboard skills, of the viennese bourgeoisie. A mass product for private consumption, somewhat similar to today’s playlists, these dances were to be enjoyed in rather informal settings within the familiar social atmosphere of the ballroom. All in all, the piano dance was not the ideal testing ground for compositional experimentalism. The entropy of the note distribution over the corpus reflects this feature. Compared to chamber arias and Lieder by Schubert himself and other earlier and later composers (Hasse, Mozart and Strauss), all somehow related to the Viennese environment, the dances show a more selective and hierarchically distributed usage of pitches (lower entropy).\n",

    " A piece of tonal music is like a journey across different regions, each being characterised by specific sonorities, moods, colours. These features of a tonal region             arise as a consequence of the choice of notes and relationships among notes that the composer assembles in that particular spot in the music. In one word, a key: with this term, we refer to (1) a set of notes and (2) a hierarchy among them, where one note (the tonic) can be thought of as the center while all other notes have different functions with respect to the tonic itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "In each piece, one key is particularly important, as it marks the final goal and often also the starting point of the music: it is the global key of the piece. However, just as painters choose colours from their palette, composers can change the “colour” of the music by shifting from key to key as the piece unfolds. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most striking  distinction is between so-called major and minor keys, that roughly correspond to happy and melancholic moods respectively. Furthermore, with respect to the global key of a piece, each other major and minor key conveys different shades of these moods. "

    "The musicological understanding of a piece relies on a detailed analysis of what is written in the score to infer the key that are encountered as it unfolds. However, to what extent does this score-based mode identification agree with the perceptual “feel” of a key? \n",
    "\n",
    "Extensive research has shown that Western listeners have consistent expectations on the fitness of individual notes into a key. For example, this plot (Krumhansl & Kessler, 1982) shows how much each one of the twelve notes is perceived as fitting into the Cmajor or Cminor keys: these are called the Cmajor and Cminor **key profiles**.\n",

    "Any fragment of music consists of a **bag of notes**, i.e. the frequency distribution of notes occurring in the fragment itself. The correlation between the bag of notes and any individual key profile is a proxy to how perceptually close to that key the fragment of music is. Each fragment of music can closely match one key, i.e. sound decidedly *in* that key, based on the corresponding perceptual expectations, or it can be ambiguously equidistant to several keys. \n"

As each key corresponds to an emotional region, how many keys does each dance cross during its journey? More than half of the dances do not touch more than three keys, and unsurprisingly the rural Ländler are tendentially more likely to be monolithic in this respect compared to all other dance types.\n",

However, this does not seem to be the case: Ländler have not generally lower downbeat vs. offbeat ratios with respect to Waltzer. This is biased, however, by a notational issue: in the well-known \"oom-pah-pah\" pattern of the Walzer, the first beat in the left hand is usually just one single note, while the second and third beats are chords; it is the performer, in these cases, that modulates the weight of the beats to convey the appropriate metrical feel.    \n",

    "However, the selected features appear not to capture the differences among the three German dance types (Deutscher, Walzer, Ländler). Furthermore, Deutscher are viable labels for all other dance types. This might point to an interpretation of the “Deutscher” as a label employed by the composer to refer generally to a dance in the “German” style, but not necessarily fitting into the categories of a Ländler or a Walzer and rather somewhat closer to the default represented by the minuet and trio. Among the German dances, Ländler are the most peculiar: it is less likely for other dance types to be mistaken for Ländler. The different taste that is addressed by the Ländler genre, with its strong folk and rural references, is thus reflected in the compositional features we have analysed. \n",
