    "## Abstract\n",
    "Everybody has an emotional access to music, which in turn transports listeners into specific moods, atmospheres and settings. This intuitive understanding of musical pieces is grounded in structural elements such as melodic motives and rhythms, with their variations or repetitions. Our project aims at gaining an objective insight into how these patterns engender different shades of musical engagement. Specifically, we will investigate the structure and composition of Franz Schubert's \"dances\", a large set of 435 piano pieces classified in seven different types according to their times’ conventions. The conventionality of these short and catchy pieces makes them an ideal testing ground for computer-assisted analysis, but also makes them highly representative of the taste of early-nineteenth-century listeners. With our statistical investigation we hope to open a window onto this past: what did listeners expect of appealing dance-like music, and did different dance types correspond to different musical features or just to different social perspectives on the same musical features?\n",

    "\n",
    "In the time between 1813 and his death in 1828, the composer Franz Schubert composed a large number of short piano pieces, the \"Dances\". Throughout his life, spent entirely in Vienna, Schubert gathered a good number of collections of such pieces which were aimed at meeting the taste of his hometown's burgeoisie. While Schubert did write long and more complex compositions for which he is famous nowadays, at the time he was better known for small and not very ambitious forms such as these \"Dances\". Since this genre can be considered as commercial music, destined to a broad audience (a bit similar to Pop music today), they are musically quite conventional and therefore represent an ideal data set for computer-assisted analysis of the musical tastes of the early 19th century.\n",

    "The “queen of all dances” (Feldtenstein, 1767) was undoubtedly the French **Menuett**. As most dance forms of the classical repertoire, the minuet originated as an appropriation of folk tunes into the stereotyped taste of nobility and courts, and in this form it was then exported throughout Europe. Traditionally, each minuet would be coupled with a contrasting dance, the **Trio**: hard to characterise collectively, trios were individually crafted to provide variety by conveying a different character from the related minuet. In general, trios were more explicit in emulating the rural origins of the dance."

    "#### Hints for music notation agnostics\n",
    "This section briefly explains some of the main elements that music scores contain. Please compare the explanations with the example score above.\n",
    ">The words '**measure**' and '**bar**' can be used interchangeably. Measures are separated by vertical bar lines designating music chunks of equal length. They also give information about the temporal hierarchy of the notes, with the ones directly after the bar line generally being the most accented.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note that MuseScore XML files contain one \\<Measure\\> node for every bar line and that we address these units with running numbers starting at zero which we call **measure counts (mc)**. The **measure numbers (mn)**, however, are those that are displayed/printed in the score. Since, say, a measure of length 3/4 (see `time signature`) can be split into two measures with irregular length for musical and notational conventions, measure numbers frequently span multiple measure counts and had to be computed by the parser following the usual conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A **staff** (pl. 'staves') is a set of usually five horizontal lines where the positioning of note heads on or between lines determines their pitch, i.e. their vertical position in terms of note name and octave.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A **clef** determines which line represents which pitch.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A **key signature** (`KeySig`) further specifies the exact pitches and reveals information as to which `key` the piece is in. A key could be defined as a hierarchy between the occurring pitches. In the example figure above, the `KeySig` of 5 $\\flat$ means that the key of this piece is either D$\\flat$ major or B$\\flat$ minor and that the pitches B, E, A, D, G have to be lowered throughout the piece. Lowering ($\\flat$) or raising ($\\sharp$) a pitch can be understood as playing the pitch just below or just above, often resulting on the piano in playing the neighbouring black key instead of a white key.\n",

    "In general, the problem of chord classification is linked to a score segmentation problem: At which time points in the score do you start considering different notes as chord and non-chord tones. But if you consider the four previous music examples, three striking facts about their harmonic content become evident:\n",

For every measure, you see the `bass` note name, the `intervals` of all sounding notes above the bass and the `label` that has been assigned to the chord type. As you can see, dominants, as well as all other chords, can occur in several permutations, depending on which of the chord tones is the bass note.

    "In the example above, the part boundaries are at (0-4), (4-8), (8-12) and (12-16).\n",
    "To automate this detection, we need to write a filter detecting these spikes.\n",
    "We use a simple rolling window $w$ of size 3, and detect for which offsets $k$ we have: $w\\!\\left[k-1\\right] < w\\!\\left[k\\right]$ and $w\\!\\left[k\\right] \\ge w\\!\\left[k+1\\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have part boundaries, we still miss which parts correspond to which boundaries.\n",
    "To answer this question, each part boundary (0-4), (4-8), ... is auto-correlated (always for $\\delta = 0$) with each of the other part boundaries of the same size.\n",
    "This allows to identify where a part repeats, e.g. in D41 menuett n°1: (0-4) repeats in (4-8) and (12-16), as these measures have a _high-enough_, pairwise auto-correlation, but does not in (8-12).\n",
    "\n",
    "_High-enough_ is an arbitrary criteria.\n",
    "In our automated process, we use the notion of a _trigger_ (_threshold_ may have been more correct from an english standpoint):\n",
    "if the auto-correlation of detected parts X and Y divided by the number of notes in X is below the _trigger_ (a value between 0 and 1), the parts are considered disticts (i.e. Y is not X).\n",
    "The normalization is a primitive form of _regularization_, favoring repetition of _less complex_ measures.\n",
    "This is also an _interpretable_ parameter, as it is the minimal fraction of notes that must repeat (same onset and same key or pitch class) to consider a repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a mechanism to merge adjacent parts for cosmetic reasons.\n",
    "For instance if a piece has a detected structure C-C-D-D-C-C, then the parts C-C and D-D can be rewritten as A = C-C and B = D-D, resulting in a visually more readable structure A-B-A.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we have a function that translates a piece (a list of notes) to its structure (a list of letters) given a _trigger_ value.\n",
    "The higher the trigger, the more certain we are repetitions actually occurred.\n",
    "Now we have one more prior knownledge to add: most of the studied pieces are short and actually contain only 2 sections, or more rarely 3.\n",
    "Using this information, for each piece we will run the structure detection algorithm for $\\left[ 0.1 ~..~ 0.9 \\right]$ by steps of $0.1$, keeping the highest trigger that leads to selecting a structure with minimal number of different parts (and, of course, at least two parts).\n",

    "# Classifying dance types\n",
    "\n",
    "This huge repertoire of piano pieces was intended for the private enjoyment of the Viennese bourgeoisie, whose social gatherings invariably involved music and, clearly, group dancing. Accordingly, each piece in the corpus bears as a title the name of one of the most common dance types of Schubert’s times. The title could not be assigned randomly, as the music had to match smoothly the common-sense expectations regarding the specific choreography that characterised each dance. Musicians and dancers were often amateurs, and yet, whenever the word “Walzer” or “Ländler” was heard everyone would also have known how the music would have sounded like, and  how to move on the dancing floor. However, it is by no means trivial to tell what the exact differences among dance types would be, and whether  these difference were encoded in the score or rather in the unspoken conventions of a specific social group, the burgeoisie, striving to establish its status and identity in the powerful and dynamic environment of the early-19th-century Vienna. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the Walzer and the Ländler could be experienced as the extremes of a continuum in a role-playing game across social classes, with the refined Walzer representing the high-class status eventually degenerating, but just for apotropaic fun, into the rural Ländler (Witzmann, 1976).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will attempt to single out musical features from the score that can be hypothesised to characterise different dance types, and assess to what extent they account for the original destination of the pieces as intended by the composer. "

A mass product for private consumption, somewhat similar to today’s playlists, these dances were to be enjoyed in rather informal settings within the familiar social atmosphere of the ballroom. All in all, the piano dance was not the ideal testing ground for compositional experimentalism. The entropy of the note distribution over the corpus reflects this feature. Compared to music from earlier and later composers, the dances show a more selective and hierarchically distributed usage of pitches (lower entropy)."

    " A piece of tonal music is like a journey across different regions, each being characterised by specific sonorities, moods, colours. These features of a tonal region             arise as a consequence of the choice of notes and relationships among notes that the composer assembles in that particular spot in the music. In one word, a key: with this term, we refer to (1) a set of notes and (2) a hierarchy among them, where one note (the tonic) can be thought of as the center while all other notes have different functions with respect to the tonic itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "In each piece, one key is particularly important, as it marks the final goal and often also the starting point of the music: it is the global key of the piece. However, just as painters choose colours from their palette, composers can change the “colour” of the music by shifting from key to key as the piece unfolds. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most striking  distinction is between so-called major and minor keys, that roughly correspond to happy and melancholic moods respectively. Furthermore, with respect to the global key of a piece, each other major and minor key conveys different shades of these moods. "

However, this does not seem to be the case: Ländler have generally not lower downbeat vs. offbeat ratios with respect to Waltzer. This is biased, however, by a notational issue: in the well-known \"oom-pah-pah\" pattern of the Walzer, the first beat in the left hand is usually just one single note, while the second and third beats are chords; it is the performer, in these cases, that modulates the weight of the beats to convey the appropriate metrical feel, which is not reflected in the notation. These exceeds the scope of a score-based approach: especially in this case, music is a tool for social interaction, and much of the music-related knowledge is diffused in the social norms of the group rather than written down in the score.  \n",

This should not be surprising, though: even for a trained musician, with implicit access to many more features than the ones we considered here and, more importantly, with appropriate means to prioritize among them, it is very hard to distinguish dance types. The performance of the model should then be gauged against the intrinsic difficulty of the task: do you think you can you do better? Here is a small game to test your classifying skills!"

    "This music, that a couple of centuries ago represented the essence of simplicity, is to our ears somewhat obscure. It hides a code of social practices, class ambitions, shy or audacious sexuality. Learning the keys to crack this code would allow us to feel familiar with the inhabitants of a distant age in the most natural way: dancing together."
