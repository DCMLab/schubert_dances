# Sheet music and section storage classes

class Sheet:
    """ Sheet music storage class.

    Attributes
    ----------
    sections : list of pandas.DataFrame
        List of sections in played order, each possibly appearing several times.

    Notes
    -----
    Compared to a standard music sheet:
    - repetitions of (contiguous) sections are specified separately.
    - many informative elements (like ties between notes) are optionally stored.

    See Also
    --------
    sheet.Section : section storage class.

    Examples
    --------
    These examples illustrate how to build a sheet with repetitions of sections.
    Once the sheet and sections are built, it is then:
    - easy to playback a sheet, by just iterating over the stored sections.
    - possible to iterate over the sections as they (plausibly) were on paper, e.g.:
        - A B B C D E D E F => A ùÑÜ B ùÑá C ùÑÜ D E ùÑá F
        - A B C B D E       => A ùÑÜ B C¬π ùÑá D¬≤ E
        - A B C A D E A C F => ùÑÜ A B¬π C¬π¬≥ D¬≤ E¬≤ ùÑá F¬≥

    >>> # Make a new sheet
    >>> my_sheet = sheet.Sheet()

    >>> # Make three sections
    >>> A, B, C = (sheet.Section(signature=(4, 4)) for _ in range(3))
    >>> # Parse and fill the columns of the sections (see 'help(sheet.Section)' for the format)
    >>> # ...
    >>> # Optional validity asserts each section once they have been fully built
    >>> for section in (A, B, C):
    ...     section.assert_format()
    ...
    >>> # Make the repetition A-B-A-C-C
    >>> for section in (A, B, A, C, C):
    ...     my_sheet.append(section)
    ...

    >>> # Iterate over the sections in playing order (i.e.: A-B-A-C-C)
    >>> for section in my_sheet.as_played():
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> # Iterate over the sections in (plausible) written order
    >>> for section, (voltas, rep_begin, rep_end) in my_sheet.as_written():
    ...     # As the structure is (ùÑÜ A B¬π ùÑáùÑÜ C¬≤ ùÑá), the loop will iterate over:
    ...     # - A, ([], True, False)
    ...     # - B, ([1], False, True)
    ...     # - C, ([-2], True, True)  <- volta value from previous pair of repetition bars is noted as negative (if any)
    ...     pass
    ...

    >>> # Save and load again the sheet
    >>> sheet.save(my_sheet, "my_sheet.sht")
    >>> my_sheet = sheet.load("my_sheet.sht")
    >>> my_sheet.assert_format()  # Optional, checks both the sheet and its sections

    A section is merely a pandas.DataFrame, augmented with a time signature.
    It is to be though as "the ink on the paper" for a continuous segment of notes,
    and absolutely not as a period; finding periods is left to subsequent analysis.

    Mandatory columns:
    - note (str)
        Note letter, one of {"A", "B", ..., "G"}.
    - octave (int)
        Octave number, any integer.
    - accidental (int)
        Accidental value, in particular: -1 for flat, 0 for natural, 1 for sharp.
    - start (:obj:`fractions.Fraction`)
        Non-negative start time point (in beats), relative to the beginning of the section.
    - duration (:obj:`fractions.Fraction`)
        Positive duration (in beats).

    Optional columns:
    - velocity (int in [1 .. 127])
        Velocity at which the note must be played.
    - hand (int)
        Which hand (or more generally which voice) is supposed to play this note.
        (To be formalized, probably something like: 0 for unknown, -1 for left, 1 for right.)

    A final silence (to play at the end of the section) is available in the member 'silence'.

    Additional metadata can be stored, available in the member dictionary 'metadata'.
    They can be used to specify details that do not directly impact the produced playback,
    as for instance if the section begins (or ends) with a double bar, etc.
